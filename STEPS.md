1. started by making files in JS and mySQL
2. made mySQL database and tables
3. began work on employee.js, making functions
    * made inquirer.prompt and functions to work through the app
    * wrote functions for each option in the main menu that triggered more inquirer.prompt, and used CRUD for the corresponding tables in mySQL

4. finished code and video'd finished program. There's a small bug where some of the lists dont update until after closing and relaunching the program.
